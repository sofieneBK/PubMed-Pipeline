# Scaling Python Code for Very Large Data Volumes

To upgrade the Python codebase that currently reads JSON and CSV files into a system capable of handling **very large volumes of data** (several terabytes or millions of files), it will be necessary to evolve the **overall architecture**, not just the code.

## 1. Data Reading

**Problem:**  
Raw reading of CSV or JSON files is slow and consumes a large amount of RAM.  
With large volumes, this quickly becomes unmanageable.

**Possible Improvements:**
- Read in chunks to limit memory usage.
- Use Big Dataâ€“optimized formats such as **Parquet** or **ORC**.

## 2. Storage

Raw or transformed data can be stored in:
- A local or remote SQL database (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).
- A cloud data warehouse such as **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, to benefit from scalability and optimized reads on large datasets.
- In a Big Data context, **object storage** (S3, GCS, Azure Blob) is preferable for files.

## 3. Search and Indexing

To improve search and filtering performance:
- Implement indexes on columns frequently used in queries.
- For large Parquet files, use **partitioning** and/or **clustering** to limit the amount of scanned data.

## 4. Parallelized Processing

Traditional sequential Python processing is insufficient for several terabytes of data.  
Use distributed computing frameworks such as **Apache Spark** (via PySpark).
